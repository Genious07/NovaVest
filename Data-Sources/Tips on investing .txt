Key Sections on Making Mistakes


"Mistakes - Yes, We Make Them at Berkshire" 


"Sometimes I've made mistakes in assessing the future economics of a business I've purchased for Berkshire - each a case of capital allocation gone wrong. That happens with both judgments about marketable equities - we view these as partial ownership of businesses - and the 100% acquisitions of companies. At other times, I've made mistakes when assessing the abilities or fidelity of the managers Berkshire is hiring. The fidelity disappointments can hurt beyond their financial impact, a pain that can approach that of a failed marriage. A decent batting average in personnel decisions is all that can be hoped for. The cardinal sin is delaying the correction of mistakes or what Charlie Munger called 'thumb-sucking.' Problems, he would tell me, cannot be wished away. They require action, however uncomfortable that may be." 










On Admitting Errors
"During the 2019-23 period, I have used the words 'mistake' or 'error' 16 times in my letters to you. Many other huge companies have never used either word over that span. Amazon, I should acknowledge, made some brutally candid observations in its 2021 letter. Elsewhere, it has generally been happy talk and pictures." 








On Corporate Culture Regarding Mistakes
"I have also been a director of large public companies at which 'mistake' or 'wrong' were forbidden words at board meetings or analyst calls. That taboo, implying managerial perfection, always made me nervous (though, at times, there could be legal issues that make limited discussion advisable. We live in a very litigious society.)" 




On the Nature of Mistakes and Success
"Every company doesn't have an easy-to-understand business and there are very few owners or managers like Pete. And, of course, I expect to make my share of mistakes about the businesses Berkshire buys and sometimes err in evaluating the sort of person with whom I'm dealing. But I've also had many pleasant surprises in both the potential of the business as well as the ability and fidelity of the manager. And our experience is that a single winning decision can make a breathtaking difference over time.  (Think GEICO as a business decision, Ajit Jain as a managerial decision and my luck in finding Charlie Munger as a one-of-a-kind partner, personal advisor and steadfast friend.) Mistakes fade away; winners can forever blossom." 










On the Original Berkshire Hathaway Mistake
"Sixty years ago, present management took control of Berkshire. That move was a mistake - my mistake - and one that plagued us for two decades. Charlie, I should emphasize, spotted my obvious error immediately: Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its business - a large northern textile operation - was headed for extinction. The U.S. Treasury, of all places, had already received silent warnings of Berkshire's destiny. In 1965, the company did not pay a dime of income tax, an embarrassment that had generally prevailed at the company for a decade. That sort of economic behavior may be understandable for glamorous startups, but it's a blinking yellow light when it happens at a venerable pillar of American industry. Berkshire was headed for the ash can." 










On Dealing with Mistakes in Controlled vs. Marketable Securities
"With marketable equities, it is easier to change course when I make a mistake. Berkshire's present size, it should be underscored, diminishes this valuable option. We can't come and go on a dime. Sometimes a year or more is required to establish or divest an investment. Additionally, with ownership of minority positions we can't change management if that action is needed or control what is done with capital flows if we are unhappy with the decisions being made. With controlled companies, we can dictate these decisions, but we have far less flexibility in the disposition of mistakes. In reality, Berkshire almost never sells controlled businesses unless we face what we believe to be unending problems."

On a Long-Term View of Earnings
"All told, we recorded operating earnings of $47.4 billion in 2024. We regularly - endlessly, some readers may groan - emphasize this measure rather than the GAAP-mandated earnings that are reported on page K-68. Our measure excludes capital gains or losses on the stocks and bonds we own, whether realized or unrealized. Over time, we think it highly likely that gains will prevail - why else would we buy these securities?  - though the year-by-year numbers will swing wildly and unpredictably. Our horizon for such commitments is almost always far longer than a single year. In many, our thinking involves decades. These long-termers are the purchases that sometimes make the cash register ring like church bells." 










On Investment Strategy and Preference for Equities
"Despite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won't change. While our ownership in marketable equities moved downward last year from $354 billion to $272 billion, the value of our non-quoted controlled equities increased somewhat and remains far greater than the value of the marketable portfolio. Berkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority of their money in equities - mostly American equities although many of these will have international operations of significance. Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned." 








On Businesses as Protection Against Monetary Instability
"Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country's short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency. Businesses, as well as individuals with desired talents, however, will usually find a way to cope with monetary instability as long as their goods or services are desired by the country's citizenry. So, too, with personal skills. Lacking such assets as athletic excellence, a wonderful voice, medical or legal skills or, for that matter, any special talents, I have had to rely on equities throughout my life. In effect, I have depended on the success of American businesses and I will continue to do so." 










On Reinvestment and Compounding
"In a very minor way, Berkshire shareholders have participated in the American miracle by foregoing dividends, thereby electing to reinvest rather than consume. Originally, this reinvestment was tiny, almost meaningless, but over time, it mushroomed, reflecting the mixture of a sustained culture of savings, combined with the magic of long-term compounding. Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished." 






On the Long-Term Japanese Investments
"Our holdings of the five are for the very long term, and we are committed to supporting their boards of directors. From the start, we also agreed to keep Berkshire's holdings below 10% of each company's shares. But, as we approached this limit, the five companies agreed to moderately relax the ceiling. Over time, you will likely see Berkshire's ownership of all five increase somewhat. At yearend, Berkshire's aggregate cost (in dollars) was $13.8 billion and the market value of our holdings totaled $23.5 billion. ...I expect that Greg and his eventual successors will be holding this Japanese position for many decades and that Berkshire will find other ways to work productively with the five companies in the future."
On Making Mistakes
Charlie Munger's Correction
"Three years later he told me correctly! that I had made a dumb decision in buying control of Berkshire. But, he assured me, since I had already made the move, he would tell me how to correct my mistake.... Nevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: 'Warren, forget about ever buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.' With much back-sliding I subsequently followed his instructions. ... Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the reins, and when I blundered he never - never -reminded me of my mistake. "










Avoiding Serious Mistakes
"One investment rule at Berkshire has not and will not change: Never risk permanent loss of capital. Thanks to the American tailwind and the power of compound interest, the arena in which we operate has been and will be rewarding if you make a couple of good decisions during a lifetime and avoid serious mistakes. "




Mistakes in Business Judgment
"We also hope these favored businesses are run by able and trustworthy managers, though that is a more difficult judgment to make, however, and Berkshire has had its share of disappointments. ... In 1863, Hugh McCulloch, the first Comptroller of the United States, sent a letter to all national banks. His instructions included this warning: 'Never deal with a rascal under the expectation that you can prevent him from cheating you.' Many bankers who thought they could 'manage' the rascal problem have learned the wisdom of Mr. McCulloch's advice and I have as well. "








Errors in 2023 Expectations
"Insurance came through as expected. I erred, however, in my expectations for both BNSF and BHE. Let's take a look at each. "




A Costly Mistake at BHE
"I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns and, along with Berkshire's two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so. "


On Long-Term Investing
Targeting "Lifetime" Shareholders
"At Berkshire, we have a more limited target: investors who trust Berkshire with their savings without any expectation of resale (resembling in attitude people who save in order to buy a farm or rental property rather than people who prefer using their excess funds to purchase lottery tickets or 'hot' stocks). Over the years, Berkshire has attracted an unusual number of such 'lifetime' shareholders and their heirs. "




The Market as a "Weighing Machine"
"It is more than silly, however, to make judgments about Berkshire's investment value based on 'earnings' that incorporate the capricious day-by-day and, yes, even year-by-year movements of the stock market. As Ben Graham taught me, 'In the short run the market acts as a voting machine; in the long run it becomes a weighing machine.' "




Owning Wonderful Businesses
"Our goal at Berkshire is simple: We want to own either all or a portion of businesses that enjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring. ... At Berkshire, we particularly favor the rare enterprise that can deploy additional capital at high returns in the future. Owning only one of these companies and simply sitting tight can deliver wealth almost beyond measure. "






Long-Duration Positions
"Last year I mentioned two of Berkshire's long-duration partial-ownership positions Coca-Cola and American Express. ... During 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke extending our own Rip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again rewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends.... The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable. "










Indefinite Holdings
"This year, I would like to describe two other investments that we expect to maintain indefinitely. ... Additionally, Berkshire continues to hold its passive and long-term interest in five very large Japanese companies, each of which operates in a highly-diversified manner somewhat similar to the way Berkshire itself is run. "




A Case Study in Patience: Bertie's Story
"Then, in 1980, when 46, and independent of any urgings from her brother, Bertie decided to make her move. Retaining only the mutual fund and Berkshire, she made no new trades during the next 43 years. During that period, she became very rich, even after making large philanthropic gifts (think nine figures). Millions of American investors could have followed her reasoning which involved only the common sense she had somehow absorbed as a child in Omaha. "


On Making Mistakes
Admission of Errors
"Over the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, many that enjoy very good economic characteristics, and a large group that are marginal. Along the way, other businesses in which I have invested have died, their products unwanted by the public."




A Report Card on Capital Allocation
"At this point, a report card from me is appropriate: In 58 years of Berkshire management, most of my capital-allocation decisions have been no better than so-so. In some cases, also, bad moves by me have been rescued by very large doses of luck. (Remember our escapes from near-disasters at USAir and Salomon? I certainly do.)"






On Deceptive Accounting
"Finally, an important warning: Even the operating earnings figure that we favor can easily be manipulated by managers who wish to do so. Such tampering is often thought of as sophisticated by CEOs, directors and their advisors. Reporters and analysts embrace its existence as well. Beating 'expectations' is heralded as a managerial triumph. That activity is disgusting. It requires no talent to manipulate numbers: Only a deep desire to deceive is required. 'Bold imaginative accounting,' as a CEO once described his deception to me, has become one of the shames of capitalism."










The Importance of Avoiding Major Mistakes
"Thus began our journey to 2023, a bumpy road involving a combination of continuous savings by our owners (that is, by their retaining earnings), the power of compounding, our avoidance of major mistakes and - most important of all the American Tailwind."


Charlie Munger on Changing Your Mind
"Warren and I hated railroad stocks for decades, but the world changed and finally the country had four huge railroads of vital importance to the American economy. We were slow to recognize the change, but better late than never."

On Long-Term Investing
We Are Business-Pickers, Not Stock-Pickers
"Our goal in both forms of ownership is to make meaningful investments in businesses with both long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers. Please note particularly that we own publicly-traded stocks based on our expectations about their long-term business performance, not because we view them as vehicles for adroit purchases and sales. That point is crucial: Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers."






The Secret Sauce of Compounding
"The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke's quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow. American Express is much the same story. Berkshire's purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely to increase."










The Lesson: Let the Flowers Bloom
"The lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well."






The Long-Term Bet on America
"I have been investing for 80 years more than one-third of our country's lifetime. Despite our citizens' penchant - almost enthusiasm for self-criticism and self-doubt, I have yet to see a time when it made sense to make a long-term bet against America. And I doubt very much that any reader of this letter will have a different experience in the future."






Charlie Munger's Wisdom on Patience and Long-Term Holding
"The world is full of foolish gamblers, and they will not do as well as the patient investor. ... Warren and I don't focus on the froth of the market. We seek out good long-term investments and stubbornly hold them for a long time. Ben Graham said, 'Day to day, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long term it's a weighing machine'."


On Making Mistakes
Admission of Errors
"I make many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses includes some enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, many others that enjoy good economic characteristics, and a few that are marginal." 


Exiting Mistakes
"One advantage of our common-stock segment is that on occasion it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is very rare in negotiated transactions and never occurs en masse. It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in the marketable arena." 






Berkshire's Early History
"After the bands stopped playing and the bankers went home, however, the shareholders reaped a disaster. In the nine years following the merger, Berkshire's owners watched the company's net worth crater from $51.4 million to $22.1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividends and plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating loss as well." 








On Long-Term Investing
We Are Business-Pickers
"Whatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable economic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectations about their long-term business performance and not because we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That point is crucial: Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers." 






Reinvestment and Compounding
"Early in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash and steered essentially all earnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through the years. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholders prospered." 




A Long-Term View on Float
"Of equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily, but their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we can therefore think long-term." 




Criteria for Long-Term Holding
"Berkshire's current 80%-or-so position in businesses is a consequence of my failure to find entire companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long-term holding." 


A Century-Long Prediction
"And here I'll venture a rare prediction: BNSF will be a key asset for Berkshire and our country a century from now." 


The Ideal "Partners"
"To a truly unusual degree, however, Berkshire has as owners a very large corps of individuals and families that have elected to join us with an intent approaching 'til death do us part.' ... Long-term individual owners are both the 'partners' Charlie and I have always sought and the ones we constantly have in mind as we make decisions at Berkshire. To them we say, 'It feels good to 'work for you, and you have our thanks for your trust.'
On Making Mistakes
The Precision Castparts Write-Down
"The final component in our GAAP figure that ugly $11 billion write-down is almost entirely the quantification of a mistake I made in 2016. That year, Berkshire purchased Precision Castparts ('PCC'), and I paid too much for the company." "No one misled me in any way I was simply too optimistic about PCC's normalized profit potential." "Last year, my miscalculation was laid bare by adverse developments throughout the aerospace industry, PCC's most important source of customers." 






Acknowledging the Error
"I was wrong, however, in judging the average amount of future earnings and, consequently, wrong in my calculation of the proper price to pay for the business." "PCC is far from my first error of that sort. But it's a big one." 




<hr>


On Long-Term Investing
Viewing Stocks as Businesses
"As I've emphasized many times, Charlie and I view Berkshire's holdings of marketable stocks - at yearend worth $281 billion as a collection of businesses." "We don't control the operations of those companies, but we do share proportionately in their long-term prosperity." 




The Power of Retained Earnings
"What's out of sight, however, should not be out of mind: Those unrecorded retained earnings are usually building value lots of value for Berkshire." "Investees use the withheld funds to expand their business, make acquisitions, pay off debt and, often, to repurchase their stock (an act that increases our share of their future earnings)." "As we pointed out in these pages last year, retained earnings have propelled American business throughout our country's history." "What worked for Carnegie and Rockefeller has, over the years, worked its magic for millions of shareholders as well." 








Focusing on Durable Businesses
"It took me a while to wise up. But Charlie and also my 20-year struggle with the textile operation I inherited at Berkshire finally convinced me that owning a non-controlling portion of a wonderful business is more profitable, more enjoyable and far less work than struggling with 100% of a marginal enterprise." "For those reasons, our conglomerate will remain a collection of controlled and non-controlled businesses." "Charlie and I will simply deploy your capital into whatever we believe makes the most sense, based on a company's durable competitive strengths, the capabilities and character of its management, and price." 






The Long-Term Bet on America
"In its brief 232 years of existence, however, there has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America." "Despite some severe interruptions, our country's economic progress has been breathtaking." "Our unwavering conclusion: Never bet against America." 






The Recipe for Wealth Creation
"Productive assets such as farms, real estate and, yes, business ownership produce wealth lots of it." "Most owners of such properties will be rewarded. All that's required is the passage of time, an inner calm, ample diversification and a minimization of transactions and fees."


On Making Mistakes
Acquisitions Record
"Over the years Berkshire has acquired many dozens of companies, all of which I initially regarded as 'good businesses.' Some, however, proved disappointing; more than a few were outright disasters. A reasonable number, on the other hand, have exceeded my hopes. In reviewing my uneven record, I've concluded that acquisitions are similar to marriage: They start, of course, with a joyful wedding but then reality tends to diverge from pre-nuptial expectations. Sometimes, wonderfully, the new union delivers bliss beyond either party's hopes. In other cases, disillusionment is swift. Applying those images to corporate acquisitions, I'd have to say it is usually the buyer who encounters unpleasant surprises. It's easy to get dreamy-eyed during corporate courtships. "












<hr>


Errors in Judgment
"Pursuing that analogy, I would say that our marital record remains largely acceptable, with all parties happy with the decisions they made long ago. Some of our tie-ups have been positively idyllic. A meaningful number, however, have caused me all too quickly to wonder what I was thinking when I proposed. Fortunately, the fallout from many of my errors has been reduced by a characteristic shared by most businesses that disappoint: As the years pass, the 'poor' business tends to stagnate, thereupon entering a state in which its operations require an ever-smaller percentage of Berkshire's capital. "








<hr>


Mistakes in Insurance
"Mistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years even decades to surface and ripen.  (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael will occur perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. "






<hr>


Acquisition Process Flaws
"Acquisition proposals remain a particularly vexing problem for board members. The legal orchestration for making deals has been refined and expanded (a word aptly describing attendant costs as well). But I have yet to see a CEO who craves an acquisition bring in an informed and articulate critic to argue against it. And yes, include me among the guilty. "








On Long-Term Investing
The Power of Retained Earnings
"In 1924, Edgar Lawrence Smith, an obscure economist and financial advisor, wrote 


Common Stocks as Long Term Investments, a slim book that changed the investment world. ... For the crux of Smith's insight, I will quote an early reviewer of his book, none other than John Maynard Keynes: 'I have kept until last what is perhaps Mr. Smith's most important, and is certainly his most novel, point. Well-managed industrial companies do not, as a rule, distribute to the shareholders the whole of their earned profits. In good years, if not in all years, they retain a part of their profits and put them back into the business. Thus there is an element of compound interest (Keynes' italics) operating in favour of a sound industrial investment. Over a period of years, the real value of the property of a sound industrial is increasing at compound interest, quite apart from the dividends paid out to the shareholders.' "








<hr>


Ignoring Market Fluctuations
"Charlie and I urge you to focus on operating earnings which were little changed in 2019 and to ignore both quarterly and annual gains or losses from investments, whether these are realized or unrealized. Our advising that in no way diminishes the importance of these investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie and I expect our equity holdings - as a group to deliver major gains, albeit in an unpredictable and highly irregular manner. "








<hr>


Value from Non-Controlled Businesses
"In the non-controlled companies, in which we own marketable stocks, only the dividends that Berkshire receives are recorded in the operating earnings we report.  The retained earnings? They're working hard and creating much added value, but not in a way that deposits those gains directly into Berkshire's reported earnings. ... Overall, the retained earnings of our investees are certain to be of major importance in the growth of Berkshire's value. "








<hr>


Equities as a Long-Term Choice
"What we can say is that if something close to current rates should prevail over the coming decades and if corporate tax rates also remain near the low level businesses now enjoy, it is almost certain that equities will over time perform far better than long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments. That rosy prediction comes with a warning: Anything can happen to stock prices tomorrow. Occasionally, there will be major drops in the market, perhaps of 50% magnitude or even greater. But the combination of The American Tailwind, about which I wrote last year, and the compounding wonders described by Mr. Smith, will make equities the much better long-term choice for the individual who does not use borrowed money and who can control his or her emotions.  Others? Beware! "












<hr>


A Multi-Decade Plan
"Today, my will specifically directs its executors as well as the trustees who will succeed them in administering my estate after the will is closed not to sell any Berkshire shares. ... In all, I estimate that it will take 12 to 15 years for the entirety of the Berkshire shares I hold at my death to move into the market. "


On Making Mistakes
Acknowledging Flawed Businesses
"Investors who evaluate Berkshire sometimes obsess on the details of our many and diverse businesses our economic 'trees,' so to speak. Analysis of that type can be mind-numbing, given that we own a vast array of specimens, ranging from twigs to redwoods. A few of our trees are diseased and unlikely to be around a decade from now. Many others, though, are destined to grow in size and beauty." 




<hr>


A Promise of Future Errors
"Berkshire will forever remain a financial fortress. In managing, I will make expensive mistakes of commission and will also miss many opportunities, some of which should have been obvious to me. At times, our stock will tumble as investors flee from equities. But I will never risk getting caught short of cash." 




<hr>


The Mistake of Overpaying
"On occasion, a ridiculously-high purchase price for a given stock will cause a splendid business to become a poor investment if not permanently, at least for a painfully long period. Over time, however, investment performance converges with business performance. And, as I will next spell out, the record of American business has been extraordinary." 


On Long-Term Investing
Ignoring Short-Term Swings
"Our advice? Focus on operating earnings, paying little attention to gains or losses of any variety. My saying that in no way diminishes the importance of our investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie and I expect them to deliver substantial gains, albeit with highly irregular timing." 




<hr>


The Value of Retained Earnings
"GAAP which dictates the earnings we report does not allow us to include the retained earnings of investees in our financial accounts. But those earnings are of enormous value to us: Over the years, earnings retained by our investees (viewed as a group) have eventually delivered capital gains to Berkshire that totaled more than one dollar for each dollar these companies reinvested for us." 




<hr>


Holding Wonderful Companies Permanently
"It would be foolish for us to sell any of our wonderful companies even if no tax would be payable on its sale. Truly good businesses are exceptionally hard to find. Selling any you are lucky enough to own makes no sense at all." 




<hr>


A Long-Term Management Viewpoint
"For 54 years our managerial decisions at Berkshire have been made from the viewpoint of the shareholders who are staying, not those who are leaving. Consequently, Charlie and I have never focused on current-quarter results. Berkshire, in fact, may be the only company in the Fortune 500 that does not prepare monthly earnings reports or balance sheets." 




<hr>


The Power of The American Tailwind
"Let's put numbers to that claim: If my $114.75 had been invested in a no-fee S&P 500 index fund, and all dividends had been reinvested, my stake would have grown to be worth (pre-taxes) $606,811 on January 31, 2019 (the latest data available before the printing of this letter). That is a gain of 5,288 for 1. Meanwhile, a $1 million investment by a tax-free institution of that time say, a pension fund or college endowment would have grown to about $5.3 billion." 




<hr>


A Multi-Generational Outlook
"Charlie and I happily acknowledge that much of Berkshire's success has simply been a product of what I think should be called The American Tailwind. It is beyond arrogance for American businesses or individuals to boast that they have 'done it alone.' ... Over the next 77 years, however, the major source of our gains will almost certainly be provided by The American Tailwind. We are lucky gloriously lucky to have that force at our back.


On Making Mistakes
On Acquisition Errors
"Once a CEO hungers for a deal, he or she will never lack for forecasts that justify the purchase. Subordinates will be cheering, envisioning enlarged domains and the compensation levels that typically increase with corporate size. Investment bankers, smelling huge fees, will be applauding as well. (Don't ask the barber whether you need a haircut.) If the historical performance of the target falls short of validating its acquisition, large 'synergies' will be forecast. Spreadsheets never disappoint".

Risk of Misjudging Insurance Losses
"My guess at this time is that the insured losses arising from the hurricanes are $100 billion or so. That figure, however, could be far off the mark. The pattern with most mega-catastrophes has been that initial loss estimates ran low. As well-known analyst V.J. Dowling has pointed out, the loss reserves of an insurer are similar to a self-graded exam. Ignorance, wishful thinking or, occasionally, downright fraud can deliver inaccurate figures about an insurer's financial condition for a very long time".

A Candid Admission
"Charlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses, not as ticker symbols to be bought or sold based on their 'chart' patterns, the 'target' prices of analysts or the opinions of media pundits. Instead, we simply believe that if the businesses of the investees are successful (as we believe most will be) our investments will be successful as well. Sometimes the payoffs to us will be modest; occasionally the cash register will ring loudly. 


And sometimes I will make expensive mistakes. Overall and over time we should get decent results. In America, equity investors have the wind at their back".

A "Terrible Mistake" for Long-Term Investors
"It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals to measure their investment 'risk' by their portfolio's ratio of bonds to stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk".

The Folly of Risking What You Have and Need
"Our aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie and I sleep well. Both of us believe it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don't need. We held this view 50 years ago when we each ran an investment partnership, funded by a few friends and relatives who trusted us. We also hold it today after a million or so 'partners' have joined us at Berkshire".

Prudence and Patience
"Despite our recent drought of acquisitions, Charlie and I believe that from time to time Berkshire will have opportunities to make very large purchases. In the meantime, we will stick with our simple guideline: The less the prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own".

The Market as a "Weighing Machine"
"The connection of value-building to retained earnings that I've just described will be impossible to detect in the short term. Stocks surge and swoon, seemingly untethered to any year-to-year buildup in their underlying value. Over time, however, Ben Graham's oft-quoted maxim proves true: 'In the short run, the market is a voting machine; in the long run, however, it becomes a weighing machine'".

Enduring Volatility
"This table offers the strongest argument I can muster against ever using borrowed money to own stocks. There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period. Even if your borrowings are small and your positions aren't immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines and breathless commentary. And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions".

On Making Mistakes
"Dumb Purchases"
"As is the case in marriage, business acquisitions often deliver surprises after the 'I do's.' I've made some dumb purchases, paying far too much for the economic goodwill of companies we acquired. That later led to goodwill write-offs and to consequent reductions in Berkshire's book value."




<hr>


Specific Errors
"Despite that cautious approach, I made one particularly egregious error, acquiring Dexter Shoe for $434 million in 1993. Dexter's value promptly went to zero. The story gets worse: I used stock for the purchase, giving the sellers 25,203 shares of Berkshire that at yearend 2016 were worth more than $6 billion.




Unfortunately, I followed the GEICO purchase by foolishly using Berkshire stock a boatload of stock to buy General Reinsurance in late 1998. After some early problems, General Re has become a fine insurance operation that we prize. It was, nevertheless, a terrible mistake on my part to issue 272,200 shares of Berkshire in buying General Re, an act that increased our outstanding shares by a whopping 21.8%. My error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that despite the Biblical endorsement is far from blessed when you are buying businesses)."

Blunders in Capital Allocation
"A few, however these are serious blunders I made in my job of capital allocation produce very poor returns. In most cases, I was wrong when I originally sized up the economic characteristics of these companies or the industries in which they operate, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. In a couple of instances, I stumbled in assessing either the fidelity or ability of incumbent managers or ones I later put in place. I will commit more errors; you can count on that."

The Long-Term Outlook for American Business
"American business and consequently a basket of stocks is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead. Innovation, productivity gains, entrepreneurial spirit and an abundance of capital will see to that. Ever-present naysayers may prosper by marketing their gloomy forecasts. But heaven help them if they act on the nonsense they peddle.








Moreover, the years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines even panics that will affect virtually all stocks. No one can tell you when these traumas will occur not me, not Charlie, not economists, not the media. ... During such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friend as an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personal fear is your enemy. It will also be unwarranted. Investors who avoid high and unnecessary costs and simply sit for an extended period with a collection of large, conservatively-financed American businesses will almost certainly do well."

The "Bet" and the Case for Index Funds
"In Berkshire's 2005 annual report, I argued that active investment management by professionals in aggregate would over a period of years underperform the returns achieved by rank amateurs who simply sat still. I explained that the massive fees levied by a variety of 'helpers' would leave their clients - again in aggregate worse off than if the amateurs simply invested in an unmanaged low-cost index fund. ... The bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds."

On Holding Stocks "Forever"
"Sometimes the comments of shareholders or media imply that we will own certain stocks 'forever.' It is true that we own some stocks that I have no intention of selling for as far as the eye can see (and we're talking 20/20 vision). But we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold any of its marketable securities forever.
On Making Mistakes
"Dumb Purchases" and Asymmetrical Accounting
"I've made some dumb purchases, and the amount I paid for the economic goodwill of those companies was later written off, a move that reduced Berkshire's book value. We've also had some winners a few of them very big-but have not written those up by a penny."

The General Re Purchase
"It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that caused commentators and me as well, briefly to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Re is now a gem."

Errors in Capital Allocation

In most of these cases, I was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the industry in which it operates, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. At other times, I stumbled in evaluating either the fidelity or the ability of incumbent managers or ones I later appointed. I will commit more errors; you can count on that."

Owning a Piece of a Wonderful Business
"At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business. It's better to have a partial interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone."

The Value of Retained Earnings
"But make no mistake: The nearly $3 billion of these companies' earnings we don't report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records. The earnings our investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock a move that increases Berkshire's share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. The retained earnings of these companies also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time."

Don't Bet Against America
"It's an election year, and candidates can't stop speaking about our country's problems (which, of course, only they can solve). As a result of this negative drumbeat, many Americans now believe that their children will not live as well as they themselves do. That view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history." "For 240 years it's been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start. America's golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs."

The Long-Term View of "Float"
"But to think of float as strictly a liability is incorrect. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims and related expenses a huge $24.5 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to float." "If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting liability.
